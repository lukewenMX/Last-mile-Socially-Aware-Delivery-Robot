# CorriereNavPCS
CorriereNavPCS is  one branch of CorriereNav
This project has been developed for addressing the social aware navigation for delivery robot on pedestrian crowded sidewalk. A systematic implementation, named CorriereNavPCS, is demonstrated here for catering three main questions: 
1) where is traversable? 
2) whare are the intentions of surrounding pedestrians? 
3) How to plan motion with social awareness (obeying traffic rules in Singapore.)
