**Safe and efficient navigation of delivery robots** in pedestrian-crowded environments is challenging and demanding since it requires robots to analyze where the traversable area is, understand the social intention of pedestrians, and plan motion with social awareness. To address this, we proposed a multi-modal socially aware navigation framework for last-mile delivery robots on pedestrian-crowded sidewalks. This framework comprises three key aspects: 
1) We introduced the **Nanyang Sidewalk dataset**, designed explicitly for class segmentation tasks on sidewalks. 
2) A multi-modal 3D detection and motion prediction integrated with the **social force model** has been introduced to perceive the intention of pedestrians. 
3) A socially aware motion planner for the delivery robot is demonstrated by following pedestrian etiquette. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.
